// Phase 22C — hero copy candidates for the marketing page.
//
// The plan locks in a mid-build workshop: render 8–10 hero claims live
// in the actual page (Fraunces 48px, gradient sweep, all the chrome) and
// pick the one that lands by sight. Until that workshop finishes, the
// SELECTED_INDEX below picks the default.
//
// Operator-locked rule: NO competitor named in any hero copy. No
// ChatGPT, no Codecademy, no Replit. The product names itself.
// Linear / Stripe / Arc do this — confident products don't elevate
// their competitors in their own headlines.
