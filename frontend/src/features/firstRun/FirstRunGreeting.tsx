//   - subtitle NAMES what they just watched + PROMISES more of it

// reduced-motion handling lives there so first-run and welcome-back
// share exactly one implementation.

  // right after "Starting your first lesson…" is a promise-break.

  // choreography still reads as a guided re-walk of the same lesson;

  // again" clicks. The only ways to land here are (a) StartPage's
  // redirect for users with welcomeDone=false, (b) explicit nav from
  // "Show intro again," or (c) a user typing /welcome directly.

  // await the server write so a reload right after the cinematic
  // doesn't re-fire the welcome-back overlay (stale server state).

  // returning-user subtitle underneath it reads as an identity
  // conflict. The first-run cinematic IS the first-run cinematic;
  // returning users opting to replay it want to see the original
  // moment, not a hybrid. Welcome-back has its own overlay with
  // its own copy (WelcomeBackOverlay / resolveWelcomeBackCopy).

  // executing and producing their name — so the line of Python is
  // recontextualized as the product's core loop, not just a demo.
