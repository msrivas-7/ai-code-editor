// Canned tutor speech for the first-run cinematic. The voice is a
// specific person — patient, warm, a touch playful, never condescending.
// Uses the learner's name only at high-stakes beats (greeting +
// celebration); overuse reads as a sales call, not a conversation.
//
// Written longhand rather than template-string-concatenated so the
// tone checks are diff-reviewable:
//   - "Hey" opens like a person, not a corporate greeting.
//   - No "I'm your tutor" — the tutor's role is implied by the setting.
//   - Single exclamation point per turn at most.
//   - No "Let's" as a verbal tic — reserved for the real transition.
//   - Backtick inline code refs so `TutorResponseView` renders them as
//     monospace tokens, matching how real tutor turns format code.
