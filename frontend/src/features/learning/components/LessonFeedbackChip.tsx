// Phase 20-P1 follow-up: contextual feedback chip shown on LessonCompletePanel.
// The persistent Feedback button in the header remains the "I have a complaint
// right now" escape hatch; this chip harvests the quieter "that was confusing
// but I wouldn't have clicked Feedback on my own" signal at peak context.
//
// Phase 20-P2 upgrade: the mood click now ALSO fires a fire-and-forget POST
// that persists a mood-only row — so we never drop the learner's signal when
// they click 😊/😐/😕 but don't type a follow-up. The modal still opens as
// an optional "want to say more?" step; if they do send one, that's a
// second row (correlated via user_id + lesson_id + time, good enough for
// triage without a join table). If the mood POST fails we swallow the
// error: a chip click shouldn't spam a toast, and the modal follow-up is
// itself a retry surface.
//
// The chip shows on EVERY lesson-complete render — even re-completions and
// subsequent lessons in the same tab. After a learner submits on a given
// completion we collapse the chip so the post-submit panel doesn't re-prompt
// them with "How was this lesson?"; next completion remounts and asks again.
// This is deliberate: different lessons surface different issues, and an
// already-completed lesson attempted again means the learner came back to it,
// which is itself useful signal.
