// Phase 20-P0 #5: centralized error type for fetch failures so user-facing
// alerts (SignupPage, LoginPage, SessionErrorBanner, tutor, OAuthButtons,
// …) surface friendly strings instead of leaked internals like
// "/api/user/preferences failed: 500 session not owned by caller".
//
// The parent `Error.message` is set to the friendly string so existing
// `(err as Error).message` catch sites get the nice version for free. The
// raw server text stays on `.body` and is `console.error`'d at the boundary
// so we can still diagnose from browser devtools / session replay.
