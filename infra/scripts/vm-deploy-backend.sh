# VM-side backend deploy with inline rollback on health-check failure.
# Called by .github/workflows/deploy.yml via az vm run-command after the
# caller has already done `git fetch` + `git reset --hard origin/main`.
#
# Why not systemctl restart? Because restarting the whole service takes Caddy
# down too (~10s of TLS interruption). `docker compose up -d backend` only
# recreates the backend container; Caddy keeps serving, and in-flight TLS
# connections survive the backend bounce.
#
# Image pinning: docker-compose still references ${IMAGE}:latest (the .env
# written by refresh-env is left alone so reboots don't diverge), but every
# deploy pulls the specific ${IMAGE}:${NEW_SHA} tag from GHCR and retags it
# to :latest locally. This replaces a floating GHCR :latest pull with an
# immutable SHA pull — what ran in CI is what runs in prod.
#
# Health gate: we poll /api/health/deep (not the shallow /api/health), so the
# rollback fires when Postgres or the docker socket-proxy dep is broken — not
# just when the process is alive. The shallow endpoint is kept for external
# uptime probes that only want "is the HTTP listener up?".
#
# Rollback: if health fails, pull ${IMAGE}:${PREV_SHA} (already in GHCR from
# the last deploy) and retag it to :latest, then compose up. Falls back to
# the local :rollback tag if the PREV_SHA pull fails (e.g. network blip).

# the backend; if a new fetch_optional line lands here that wasn't on the
# live VM, .env grows by one var → hash differs → backend recreates with
# fresh env BEFORE the image swap below. Idempotent: if the script body
# is unchanged, install-with-same-perms is essentially free.
