# /usr/local/bin/refresh-env — re-render /opt/codetutor/.env from Key Vault.
#
# Sourced from this repo on every deploy (vm-deploy-backend.sh) so adding a
# new KV secret propagates without VM reprovision. Per-VM identity values
# (KV_NAME, image tags, FQDN, admin email) live in /etc/codetutor/env.conf,
# which is written once at first-boot via cloud-init template substitution.
#
# Drift fix (2026-04-29): extracted from cloud-init.yaml's inline write_files
# entry. The previous shape baked {{KV_NAME}} + sibling template vars into
# the shipped script at first-boot only; subsequent edits to cloud-init.yaml
# never reached the live VM unless someone SSH'd in and patched manually.
# Now this file is the source of truth and a deploy step keeps the VM in sync.

# is a no-op for containers whose compose-level config is unchanged —
# .env var diffs don't trigger a restart on their own. Without this,
# rotating BYOK_ENCRYPTION_KEY in Key Vault would silently do nothing
# until a VM reboot, and the next boot's freshly-recreated container
# would come up with the new master key → every stored ciphertext
# suddenly undecryptable. Force-recreate on change closes that gap.
