// P-3 scaffold: user-owned data export. One entry point queries every table
// the learner owns a row in, strips non-user fields (encrypted secrets,
// internal denorm columns), and returns a JSON bundle the route streams
// back. Scope decisions:
//
//   * `user_preferences` — included EXCEPT `openai_api_key_cipher` and
//     `openai_api_key_nonce`. The key is encrypted at rest with a master
//     key the user doesn't own, so exporting ciphertext would be noise.
//     `has_openai_key` boolean flag is included so the user knows whether
//     they set one. Nonce is dropped to match.
//   * `course_progress` / `lesson_progress` / `editor_project` — full rows.
//   * `ai_usage_ledger` — tokens, cost, model, route, created_at only.
//     Rows do not store prompts or outputs; the schema ensures this.
//   * `paid_access_interest` / `ai_platform_denylist` — full row if present,
//     `null` if absent. Denylist reason is operator-written and shown per
//     GDPR Art. 15 ("right of access") — a learner flagged as abusive is
//     entitled to see the reason the operator recorded.
//   * `feedback` — only rows currently owned by this user (user_id =
//     auth.uid()). Ghost rows (user_id IS NULL) from previous account
//     deletions are never re-associated.
//
// Deliberately excluded:
//   * `user_ai_costs` — internal denorm rebuildable from ai_usage_ledger.
//   * `auth.users` row — email is already visible to the user via Supabase
//     Auth; including it here duplicates without adding to the Art. 15 story.
