// Phase 22D: daily streak-nudge sweeper.
//
// Cadence: fires once daily at 18:00 UTC. v1 doesn't track per-user
// timezones (the plan defers that to v2), so the global window picks a
// time that hits as a "tonight" reminder for North America (~11am-2pm
// PT/ET) and an "early evening" for Europe (~6-8pm local). Asia gets a
// next-morning reminder which still works for "yesterday slipped".
//
// Mechanism: setTimeout to the next 18:00 UTC. On fire, runs the sweep,
// then schedules the next 24h fire. Boot-time catch-up: if the backend
// container restarts after 18:00 UTC on a given day, fire immediately
// — the SELECT's idempotency filter (last_streak_email_sent_at <
// CURRENT_DATE) prevents double-sends to anyone already mailed.
//
// Why setTimeout-to-target vs setInterval(60s)-and-check: the latter
// burns 1440 polls per day for one send. setTimeout is precise and
// idle-cheap. Same energy as cron but in-process — no external job
// scheduler needed for a single-VM indie product.

// Eligibility query:
//   - JOIN user_streak (must have a streak >= 1 AND last_active_date =
//     yesterday-UTC — i.e. the user was active yesterday but not today)
//   - JOIN user_preferences (opt_in = true AND not already mailed today)
//   - JOIN auth.users (email exists AND email_confirmed_at IS NOT NULL —
//     unconfirmed accounts NEVER get retention email; industry norm +
//     CAN-SPAM hygiene + reduces signup-spam abuse)
//   - LATERAL JOIN to course_progress for the deep-link target. LEFT
//     LATERAL because users without any course_progress row should still
//     get the email (deep link falls back to /start).
