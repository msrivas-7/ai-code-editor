Learning objectives:
${objectives}

Concepts this lesson TEACHES (new to the learner — lean into these): ${formatTagList(ctx.teachesConceptTags)}
Concepts this lesson USES (already taught earlier — reference briefly, don't re-teach): ${formatTagList(ctx.usesConceptTags)}
Concepts taught in EARLIER lessons (safe to reference): ${formatTagList(ctx.priorConcepts)}

The student must: ${task}
Progress: ${ctx.studentProgressSummary}

IMPORTANT LESSON RULES:
- Stay within the scope of this lesson's objectives.
- Do not introduce concepts that are NOT listed in "TEACHES", "USES", or "EARLIER lessons" above — those are future material the learner hasn't seen yet.
- Reference the specific task the student is working on.
- Guide toward the solution without giving it away.
- If the student is stuck, give progressively stronger hints tied to the lesson task.`;
