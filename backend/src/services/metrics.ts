// /api/metrics — Prometheus exposition for lightweight external scraping.
// Three signals matter for steady-state ops:
//   - session_count: active runner containers. Should oscillate around low
//     single digits; a monotonic climb means the sweeper isn't catching
//     stale sessions (leaked-container detector).
//   - ai_tokens_consumed_total: OpenAI tokens across all users. Useful for
//     spotting a runaway history or a looped client burning spend.
//   - exec_duration_seconds: histogram of run-code latency by language +
//     ok. First-boot Rust compiles will pile the top bucket; steady-state
//     Python should sit under 1s.
//
// No scraper is wired yet — the endpoint ships ahead of the Prom stack so
// the instrumentation is live when we turn one on. Endpoint is public (no
// bearer): the data is aggregate-only and consistency with the Prometheus
// convention outweighs hiding magnitudes at this size. A Caddy path guard
// or env-bearer can be added later without touching these definitions.
