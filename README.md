# AI Code Editor

A local-first, web-based coding editor with an AI tutor. Write small single- or multi-file projects in the browser, run them in a sandboxed Docker runtime, and get structured, hint-style help from OpenAI using your own API key.

## Features

- **Multi-file editor** powered by Monaco with a custom dark theme, bracket-pair colorization, and JetBrains Mono ligatures. Tabs above the editor (click to switch, middle-click or ✕ to close); file tree on the left.
- **Flexible layout.** Resizable left (files), right (tutor), and bottom (output) panes with draggable splitters — double-click a splitter to reset to its default width. Files and tutor panels collapse to a thin rail so the editor gets the full screen when you want it.
- **One-click Run** (`⌘↵` / `Ctrl+↵`) in a per-session Docker container: network disabled, CPU/memory/PID limits, non-root user, 10s wall-clock cap.
- **Stdin support.** Dedicated **stdin** tab in the output panel; every starter reads from stdin and is pre-filled with sample input so the first Run produces meaningful output.
- **Nine languages** — Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, C, C++, Java, Go, Rust, Ruby. Each ships with a runnable multi-file starter project.
- **AI tutor** via the OpenAI Responses API with a strict JSON schema, streamed over SSE so summary/explanation/hint/next-step sections paint as they arrive. Per-turn context includes a diff of files edited since the last turn plus run/edit counters, so the tutor sees what the student actually changed.
- **Persona slider** — beginner / intermediate / advanced, set in Settings, reshapes the system prompt every turn (vocabulary depth, assumed background, explanation density).
- **Stuckness detection.** The model emits a `stuckness: low | medium | high` signal each turn, combined with client-side run/edit activity. When stuckness goes high, the tutor unlocks a stronger hint and a concrete next step — still never the full fix.
- **Clickable error + code references.** `file.ext:line[:col]` in tutor prose and stderr becomes a button that jumps the editor to the location.
- **"Walk me through this"** button on the editor tab strip. One click asks the tutor to walk through the active file step by step — great for reading an unfamiliar file or onboarding to a starter project.
- **Quick-action chips.** One-click "Why did my last run fail?" on errored runs, plus follow-up suggestions after a tutor turn — all fire asks directly instead of prefilling the composer.
- **Long-conversation compression.** Once history crosses a threshold, older turns are summarized in the background and injected as a synthetic context head on subsequent turns — non-blocking; the current ask never waits for it.
- **Bring-your-own key.** Held in-memory on the frontend by default, or in `localStorage` behind an explicit opt-in. Sent server-side via `X-OpenAI-Key` per request; never logged, never written to disk.
- **Resilient sessions.** Silent heartbeat retries, a `Reconnecting…` status, and rebind-to-same-ID recovery when the backend session expires.
- **Keyboard-first UI.** Status bar, color-coded file icons, output panel with copy-to-clipboard, error-type chips, and inline keyboard hints.

## Prerequisites

You need **Git** and **Docker Desktop** installed. That's it — everything else (Node, Python, compilers) runs inside Docker containers and is set up automatically on first launch.

- **Git** — [download](https://git-scm.com/downloads). On macOS, `git` is also installed when you run `xcode-select --install`.
- **Docker Desktop** — [download](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/). Free for personal use. Available for macOS, Windows, and Linux.
  - Make sure Docker Desktop is **running** before you start. You should see a whale icon in your menu bar (macOS) or system tray (Windows).

Optional: an **OpenAI API key** ([get one here](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)) if you want the AI tutor. The editor and Run button work without a key; only the right-hand tutor panel requires one.

### System requirements

- ~4 GB free RAM while the stack is running.
- ~2 GB disk for the Docker images (first-time build only).
- Internet connection for the first build (to pull base images). After that, works offline for editing and running code. Only the AI tutor needs internet.

## First-time setup

Pick your OS. Each section is self-contained — you don't need to read the others.

### macOS

1. **Install Docker Desktop** from the link above. Open it. Wait until the whale icon in your menu bar stops animating (means the daemon is running).
2. **Open Terminal** (press `⌘ + Space`, type "Terminal", hit Enter).
3. **Clone the repo** and enter the folder:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/msrivas-7/ai-code-editor.git
   cd ai-code-editor
   ```
4. **Launch:**
   ```bash
   ./start.sh
   ```
5. The first launch will build the Docker images — this takes **2–3 minutes** and is only slow the first time. You'll see three Terminal windows open (backend logs, frontend logs, session runners) and your browser will open to **http://localhost:5173**. That's the editor.

To stop everything: `./stop.sh`. To start it again later: `./start.sh` (subsequent launches take ~10 seconds since the images are already built).

### Linux

Same as macOS, but install Docker Desktop for Linux (or `docker.io` / `docker-ce` + `docker-compose-plugin` from your distro). Make sure your user is in the `docker` group so you don't need `sudo`:
```bash
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
# log out and back in for this to take effect
```
Then follow macOS steps 3–5. On Linux, `start.sh` doesn't auto-open log windows (that's macOS-specific); you can tail logs manually with `docker compose logs -f backend` if needed.

### Windows

1. **Install Docker Desktop** from the link above. During install, leave "Use WSL 2 instead of Hyper-V" checked (the default). Reboot if asked.
2. **Start Docker Desktop.** Wait until the whale icon in your system tray stops animating.
3. **Enable file sharing for your drive.** Open Docker Desktop → **Settings** (gear icon) → **Resources** → **File Sharing**. Make sure the drive you'll clone into (usually `C:`) is checked. Click **Apply & Restart** if you changed anything.
4. **Open PowerShell.** Press `Windows key`, type "PowerShell", hit Enter. (Any PowerShell window is fine — no need for "Admin".)
5. **Clone the repo** and enter the folder:
   ```powershell
   git clone https://github.com/msrivas-7/ai-code-editor.git
   cd ai-code-editor
   ```
6. **Launch:**
   ```powershell
   powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\start.ps1
   ```
   (The `-ExecutionPolicy Bypass` bit is because Windows blocks unsigned scripts by default. This only bypasses the policy for this one command — it doesn't change any system setting.)
7. First launch builds the images — **2–3 minutes**. Three PowerShell windows will open for logs and your browser will open to **http://localhost:5173**.

To stop: `.\stop.ps1`. To start again: re-run the launch command in step 6.

## Quick start (after first-time setup)

Once everything is installed, day-to-day use is just:

| | macOS / Linux | Windows |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Start** | `./start.sh` | `powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\start.ps1` |
| **Stop**  | `./stop.sh`  | `.\stop.ps1` |

Or, if you'd rather drive Docker Compose directly (works on all three OSes):

```bash
docker compose up --build    # start (foreground; Ctrl-C to stop)
docker compose down           # stop
```

## Troubleshooting

**"Cannot connect to the Docker daemon" / "docker: command not found"** — Docker Desktop isn't running, or isn't installed. Open it and wait for the whale icon to stop animating.

**"Bind mount failed" (Windows)** — Docker Desktop doesn't have permission to the drive your repo is on. Open Docker Desktop → Settings → Resources → File Sharing → enable the drive → Apply & Restart.

**Port 4000 or 5173 already in use** — something else on your machine is using those ports. Stop it, or edit `docker-compose.yml` to map different ports (e.g., change `"5173:5173"` to `"5174:5173"` and open the new port in your browser).

**Windows: "cannot be loaded because running scripts is disabled"** — You ran `.\start.ps1` directly. Use the full command: `powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\start.ps1`.

**Windows: `MAX_PATH` errors on deep workspaces** (rare) — Enable long paths in an Admin PowerShell and reboot:
```powershell
reg add "HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\FileSystem" /v LongPathsEnabled /t REG_DWORD /d 1 /f
```

**First build is slow** — Expected (2–3 min). Subsequent launches use the cache and take ~10 seconds. You can watch progress in the Terminal/PowerShell window where you ran `start.sh` / `start.ps1`.

**Nothing happens when I open http://localhost:5173** — Give it another 10 seconds; the frontend dev server takes a moment to warm up on first launch. Check the frontend log window for any errors.

## Using it

Open <http://localhost:5173>. The editor seeds with a starter project for the selected language. Edit any file, hit **Run** (or `⌘↵`), and stdout/stderr stream back into the output panel with an exit code, duration, and error classification (`compile`, `runtime`, `timeout`, `system`). Switch to the **stdin** tab in the output panel to edit the input piped into the program on the next Run.

To enable the tutor, click the gear in the right sidebar, paste an OpenAI key, validate, pick a model, and choose a persona (beginner / intermediate / advanced) that shapes how explanations are phrased. Ask a question in the tutor panel — Enter sends, Shift+Enter inserts a newline. Responses stream section-by-section (summary → explanation → example → hint → next step). The first response leans on diagnostic questions; follow-ups add hints; when the tutor flags you as stuck — based on your prose ("I'm stuck", "just tell me") and activity signals like repeated failed runs — it unlocks a stronger pointer and a concrete next step. `file.ext:line` references in the response jump the editor there on click. The tab strip and output panel also surface one-click action chips ("Walk me through this", "Why did my last run fail?") that fire asks directly.

Switching the language dropdown replaces the current project with that language's starter (with a confirmation prompt so you don't accidentally nuke work).

## Architecture

```
┌───────────┐   HTTP/JSON   ┌───────────┐   docker.sock   ┌──────────────┐
│  Frontend │ ────────────> │  Backend  │ ──────────────> │ Runner cntr  │
│ (React +  │               │ (Express+ │   (sibling)     │  (one per    │
│  Monaco)  │ <──────────── │  dockerode│ <────────────── │   session)   │
└───────────┘               └───────────┘                 └──────────────┘

```

- **One container per active editor session.** Started lazily on the first Run, reaped 2 minutes after the last heartbeat or immediately on tab close (`pagehide` → `navigator.sendBeacon`).
- **Bind-mounted workspace.** Files live at `./temp/sessions/{sessionId}` on the host and are mounted into the runner at `/workspace`. Each Run wipes and re-writes this directory from the frontend snapshot, so backend restarts don't lose user code.
- **Sandboxing.** Network disabled, CPU/memory/PID caps, non-root user inside the container, `no-new-privileges`, 10s wall-clock on every exec.

### API surface

| Method | Path | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `POST` | `/api/session` | Create a session + runner container |
| `POST` | `/api/session/ping` | Heartbeat |
| `POST` | `/api/session/rebind` | Reuse the same ID after expiry |
| `POST` | `/api/session/end` | Destroy session + container |
| `POST` | `/api/project/snapshot` | Write the full project into the workspace |
| `POST` | `/api/execute` | Compile (if needed) and run |
| `POST` | `/api/ai/validate-key` | Check an OpenAI key |
| `GET`  | `/api/ai/models` | List chat-capable models for the key |
| `POST` | `/api/ai/ask/stream` | Tutor turn (SSE stream of structured JSON sections) |
| `POST` | `/api/ai/ask` | Tutor turn (non-streaming; same schema) |
| `POST` | `/api/ai/summarize` | Compress older history into a short narrative for long conversations |

### Docker socket note

The backend mounts `/var/run/docker.sock` so it can spawn sibling runner containers. This gives the backend root-equivalent access to the local Docker daemon — fine for local use, **not** suitable for a publicly hosted deployment without further sandboxing (rootless Docker, a dedicated runner service, or a job queue).

## Development

Running the full stack via `./start.sh` or `docker compose up` needs no host-side installs — the Dockerfiles handle `npm ci` and system packages inside the images. Only install locally if you want to iterate outside Docker (type-checks, hot-reload frontend against a containerized backend, etc.):

```bash
# One-time host-side install for local iteration
(cd frontend && npm install)
(cd backend  && npm install)

# Type-check without running the stack
(cd frontend && npx tsc --noEmit)
(cd backend  && npx tsc --noEmit)

# Run unit tests (vitest / node:test)
(cd frontend && npm test)
(cd backend  && npm test)

# Iterate on the frontend only (backend in Docker)
docker compose up -d backend
cd frontend && npm run dev

# Rebuild just the backend after backend changes
docker compose build backend && docker compose up -d --no-deps backend
```
